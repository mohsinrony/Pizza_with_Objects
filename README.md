# Pizza Order Application

This is a web application built as part of an assignment for the **Full Stack Developer Program**. The app models the process of ordering pizzas, calculating their prices, and managing customer details and delivery types.

## Assignment Overview

This project is divided into two main tasks:

### **Task 1**: Model a Pizza

- **Objective**: Write code that models a pizza as a class. A pizza should have at least the following properties:
  - Name
  - Toppings
  - Base price for a small pizza
- **Functionality**: The pizza class should have a function that calculates the pizza's price, considering the toppings and size.

### **Task 2**: Model a Pizza Order

- **Objective**: Write code that models an order to a pizza place as a class. An order includes:
  - Customer name
  - Delivery type
  - Multiple pizzas can be added to the order
- **Functionality**: The order class should have a method to add pizzas to it, and it should calculate the total price of the order, including the delivery charge.

## Features

- **Pizza Menu**: Select pizzas from the menu and customize them by adding toppings.
- **Topping Prices**: Add extra toppings for an additional cost. The app automatically adjusts the price based on the number of toppings selected.
- **Pizza Sizes**: Choose from different pizza sizes (Small, Medium, Large) with corresponding price adjustments.
- **Delivery Type**: Select the delivery type (Eat In, Take Out, Delivery) to calculate additional charges.
- **Total Price Calculation**: The app calculates the total order price, considering the selected pizzas, toppings, sizes, and delivery type.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for managing pizzas, orders, and price calculations.
